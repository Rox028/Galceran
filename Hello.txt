What challenges did you face during this activity
    => The challenges I face during this activity is that starting with Git is every confusing to me, 
       specially understanding the command on what to do first, and sometimes I accidentally type an
       incorrect commant spelling, like using "comit" instead of "commit". Just a simple mistake can cause
       an errors that I had to troubleshoot.

Which Git command was the most confusing?
    => The most confusing Git command for me was the "git push". because without a proper initial commit or
       without the actual files, there was nothing to push. The error message about the "src refspec main does not 
       match any" was also confusing for me at first, but later on I learned what it meant that the branch did not have 
       any commits to push.

How can version control help in real-world software development?
    => the version control can help in real-world software development especially in using Git, because it allows the 
       team to work together on a same project. It can also tracks the every changes that is made to the code, making 
       it easy to review the history, finding the bugs, and even revert to earlier versions if something goes wrong.
       The developers can also work on adding ner features or finding and fixing the bugs in a separate branches, 
       ensuring that the main codebase stays the same until the changes are fully tested and ready.
